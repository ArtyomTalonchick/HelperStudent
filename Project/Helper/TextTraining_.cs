            array = "As the saying goes - if you want something to be done well, do it yourself. I follow this wise advice and I would like to introduce myself. My name is Nikita Kovalevich. I was born on June 20, 1998. I am 18 years old. I come from Minsk, Belarus. How do I see myself? I am an active and energetic person. I can’t bear just sitting around and doing nothing. It just makes me impatient and restless. But I know what I want, and I think I have got what it takes to achieve my goals. I am a hard worker when it comes to what I am interested in. Does it make me sound horribly ambitious and selfish? I hope not! I am friendly, kind, and honest. I have my own likes and dislikes. I enjoy other people’s company. Friends visit me regularly and I never feel lonely. I am modest and sometimes shy, but I would not advise anyone tricking or kidding me. I am the kind of person who doesn’t let friends down. I do not like hypocrisy. I always say in open what I think. It is very difficult for me to deal with people who are selfish and dishonest. This summer I passed the entrance examinations in the form of centralized testing and on the basis of the results was admitted to the University. Now I’m a first-year student of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics where I’m taking programming. So my main duty is to study at university. I am a full-time student and my day-to-day activities depend on my timetable. My classes usually begin at 8 a.m. Every day I get up at half past six and go jogging in the park. It takes me thirty minutes. Then I do some morning exercises. That’s why I never feel sleepy in the morning. I feel refreshed and full of energy. When I am back I take a cold shower and have breakfast. I like talking to my parents while having it. I leave at about 7.45 a.m. If the weather is fine I get to the university by bicycle. The University is situated in the city center. It takes me 20 minutes to get there. As a rule my classes start at 8 a.m. I have 3 or 4 classes a day: lectures, seminars, practical classes and lab works. They are usually over at 3 p.m. I go to the sports center where I have karate trainings three times a week. I also take guitar lessons. I come home at 7 p.m. I have dinner and start doing my homework. If  I have some spare time I play the guitar or read classical literature. I go to bed at about half past eleven. I think it is very important to go to bed before midnight and get up early in the morning, especially on weekdays. Thus you can manage everything you plan to do. At weekends I usually get up at 8 oʼclock and do the same things I do on weekdays. Sometimes I have a rehearsal with the rock band where I play the guitar. Sometimes I can stay home, read books, or hang out with my friends. I can’t imagine my life without my family. It isnʼt big. There are four of us: my father, mother and a sister. My father is a well-educated and knowledgeable person. That is why it is always interesting to talk to him: he usually tells a lot of exciting stories. My mother is a nice person. I admire her character. She is an optimist. She is full of energy and enthusiasm. I really like her sense of humour. My mother is a housewife. It takes her much time and patience to look after the house. But she copes with her household chores very well. Besides, both my father and I help her with the housework. For example, I do the dishes and my father goes shopping. She is keen on cooking so she spends much time in the kitchen. My father likes stamp collecting and when a child I got interested in it as well. Since that time, stamps and old coins have become my hobby. We have a big collection of them. We also like music and everybody who visits us is impressed with our CD and DVD collection. I enjoy spending time with my family very much. We often go for a walk together. My family is fond of travelling. We visit different countries and have great time. So I could definitely say we are a very friendly family.                                          ";

Great Britain is the largest of the British Isles. It comprises, together with numerous smaller islands, England and Scotland, and the principality of Wales. Northern Ireland, also known as Ulster, occupies the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland. The United Kingdom is separated from continental Europe by the English Channel, in the east it is limited by the North Sea, and in the west by the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The only land border is between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland .The total area of the United Kingdom is 242 sq km. The names United Kingdom, Great Britain and England are often used interchangeably. The use of Great Britain, often shortened to Britain, to describe the whole kingdom is common and widely accepted, although strictly speaking it does not include Northern Ireland. However, the use of the word «England» to mean the United Kingdom is not acceptable to members of the other constituent countries, especially the Scots and the Welsh. England and Wales were united administratively, politically and legally by 1543. The crowns of England and Scotland were united in 1603, but these two countries remained separate political entities until the 1707 Act of Union, which formed the Kingdom of Great Britain with a single legislature. From 1801, when Great Britain and Ireland were united, until the formal establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, the kingdom was officially named the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The mainland of the island of Great Britain is 974 km at its longest part and 531 km at its widest. However, the highly indented nature of the island’s coastline means that nowhere there is a place more than about 120 km from the sea. The climate of the United Kingdom is mild relative to its latitude, which is the same as that of Labrador in Canada. The mildness is an effect of the warm Gulf Stream. Winter temperatures seldom are below – 10 ºC and summer temperatures rarely higher than 32 ºC. The sea winds also bring plenty of moisture, average annual precipitation is more than 1,000 mm. The population of the country is more than 56 mln people, but it is one of the world’s leading commercial and industrialized nations. In terms of gross national product (GNP) it ranks fifth in the world, with Italy, after the United States, Japan, Germany and France.                                          ";

Water and soil pollution, the destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain, global warming, deforestation, oil spills, littering are among the most serious ones. Every year the world’s industry pollutes the atmosphere with millions of tons of dust and other harmful substances. The seas and rivers are poisoned with industrial waste and poisonous chemicals. During many processes poisonous gases (carbon dioxide, for example) are released into the air. These gases destroy the ozone layer of the atmosphere. It is very dangerous, because this ozone layer protects the Earth against the space radiation which can be harmful to both people and wild nature. Acid rain is found mostly in Europe and North America. These areas of the planet have the most cars and power stations, which produce harmful chemicals. These then go into the air and mix with the water in clouds to produce acid rain. The trouble begins when polluted rain falls as it damages plants and animals. In fact the fish in hundreds of lakes in Europe and North America have almost died out completely because of acid rain. Cities are also suffering from the effects of this powerful form of pollution. Acid rain can slowly eat away the stone on the outside walls of buildings, and historic monuments can be severely damaged. Many species of animals are endangered because they are losing their natural habitat or their food is contaminated with pesticides which slowly kill them. Many animals suffer from illegal hunting. Some man-made accidents threaten wildlife and the ecosystem. Although these accidents are relatively rare because of increased safety procedures, accidents still occur, sometimes with devastating effects. Examples include oil spills, radioactive leaks, tanker spills, pipeline bursts. Water is precious but it is also a scarce resource that needs to be preserved for future generations. Sustainable use of it is therefore vital to enable future life of our planet. Water pollution is a growing problem globally. Large industries including those that make chemicals and plastics dump a large amount of waste into the water. Human waste and rubbish also end up in the oceans and lakes. The mishandling of hazardous waste materials poses immediate and long-term risks to plants, animals, humans and the environment. Man-made chemicals released into the dirt either by accident or through poor disposal techniques cause soil contamination. Rupture of underground storage tanks, acid rain, leaching of hazardous waste from landfills, pesticides, and discharge from industrial chemical wastes all can contaminate the soil in which farmers grow crops or graze livestock that people eventually eat. On the other hand, if the pollution is not stopped we’ll die out anyway. We must set up national parks, protect natural habitat of animals, introduce harsher punishments for poaching and reduce demand for fur, ivory etc. We must invent new, waste-free and nature-friendly technologies and encourage industries to use cleaner methods of production. We should educate the public about the importance of recycling and raise public awareness about endangered species. We must develop and produce special water and air purifiers and filters. There is an international organization called Green Peace which fights against pollution and protects our nature. There is a good formula of RRR. It is Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. We can reduce the usage of electricity and drinking water. We must make an effort to recycle such things as plastic bottles, metal, paper, glass. The topic of environmental problems and their effective solutions is quite complicated and difficult to understand. It is, however, the attitude of human beings towards using the natural resources that is going to influence the environment to a great extent.                                           ";

            array = "The IT profession is respected globally because of the impact Information Technology (IT) has on society.  IT is used in solving problems and creating solutions. All sectors of the economy require the services of skilled technical IT personnel. Information technology professionals are responsible for designing, developing, supporting and managing computer hardware, computer software, maintaining, installing, configuring and managing IT systems and networks, including the Internet. IT is a field that emphasizes knowledge and personal contribution. A career in IT offers not only money, but much more than money. A career is about self-actualization issues – knowledge, empowerment, recognition, opportunity, influence, reputation, and self-reliance. But if immediate results are what you are after, then the IT field might not be what you want. An IT career is more like a marathon than a short sprint. Most computer related jobs require a bachelor’s degree. For some positions, a master's degree is preferred. Relevant skills and experience matter. The way to become an IT professional is studying a degree at university which teaches you the fundamentals first. At the university you not only get the knowledge but also: get the stamp on your résumé (Once they open a certain job, organizations use filters to fill it in appropriately, and one of the filters is the university degree); create  the network of people (meeting different people increases your possibilities to find a good job; getting in contact with professors,  lecturers and the like might help you to develop professional projects, the university also offers many channels to get in touch with companies and organizations, including the contact of people working inside the HR department.); develop the competencies. Apart from the knowledge the university teaches you how to collect, filter, interpret and present information. It also teaches you to communicate clearly, to interact with other people, to take responsibility of your actions, and so on. All those competencies will be useful for the rest of your life regardless of the career you will choose. The knowledge you learn at the university will come and go while competencies stay once you develop them. Knowing what to expect out of something is half way through, so make sure you get it all from your experience at the university. In IT tomorrow is unpredictable. This is the very field where if you stand still you will go backwards. Once you have more information you are in a better position to know what you want. Be resourceful in finding information and keeping yourself up to date. Keep on learning and acquiring knowledge through the Internet, books, training and practice. Read IT journals and the computer sections of most newspapers and magazines. Talk to people on the job – get info on the good and the bad. As the Chinese proverb states, the stranger that asks questions doesn’t get lost. Visit the workplace, get familiar with and understand the working environments. Competent IT practitioners are often respected and recognized for their contributions. Becoming respected in IT requires creativity, the ability to handle challenges, to have excellent problem solving skills, a healthy respect for others and an always-learning attitude. The profession is respected but each individual must create his or her own path. You can be highly respected in IT if you manage your relationships well. You need to have very good interpersonal skills and know the value of good teamwork. Do you help and encourage others? You know the stuff, you’ve got the certs but how courteous are you in making your demands? Will you treat colleagues, clients and employers with respect? Are you considerate and evenhanded in your interactions and working relationships? The way you resolve conflict is also about respect.                                          ";
