As the saying goes - if you want something to be done well, do it yourself. I follow this wise advice and I would like to introduce myself. My name is Nikita Kovalevich. I was born on June 20, 1998. I am 18 years old. I come from Minsk, Belarus. How do I see myself? I am an active and energetic person. I can’t bear just sitting around and doing nothing. It just makes me impatient and restless. But I know what I want, and I think I have got what it takes to achieve my goals. I am a hard worker when it comes to what I am interested in. Does it make me sound horribly ambitious and selfish? I hope not! I am friendly, kind, and honest. I have my own likes and dislikes. I enjoy other people’s company. Friends visit me regularly and I never feel lonely. I am modest and sometimes shy, but I would not advise anyone tricking or kidding me. I am the kind of person who doesn’t let friends down. I do not like hypocrisy. I always say in open what I think. It is very difficult for me to deal with people who are selfish and dishonest. This summer I passed the entrance examinations in the form of centralized testing and on the basis of the results was admitted to the University. Now I’m a first-year student of the Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics where I’m taking programming. So my main duty is to study at university. I am a full-time student and my day-to-day activities depend on my timetable. My classes usually begin at 8 a.m. Every day I get up at half past six and go jogging in the park. It takes me thirty minutes. Then I do some morning exercises. That’s why I never feel sleepy in the morning. I feel refreshed and full of energy. When I am back I take a cold shower and have breakfast. I like talking to my parents while having it. I leave at about 7.45 a.m. If the weather is fine I get to the university by bicycle. The University is situated in the city center. It takes me 20 minutes to get there. As a rule my classes start at 8 a.m. I have 3 or 4 classes a day: lectures, seminars, practical classes and lab works. They are usually over at 3 p.m. I go to the sports center where I have karate trainings three times a week. I also take guitar lessons. I come home at 7 p.m. I have dinner and start doing my homework. If  I have some spare time I play the guitar or read classical literature. I go to bed at about half past eleven. I think it is very important to go to bed before midnight and get up early in the morning, especially on weekdays. Thus you can manage everything you plan to do. At weekends I usually get up at 8 o?clock and do the same things I do on weekdays. Sometimes I have a rehearsal with the rock band where I play the guitar. Sometimes I can stay home, read books, or hang out with my friends. I can’t imagine my life without my family. It isn?t big. There are four of us: my father, mother and a sister. My father is a well-educated and knowledgeable person. That is why it is always interesting to talk to him: he usually tells a lot of exciting stories. My mother is a nice person. I admire her character. She is an optimist. She is full of energy and enthusiasm. I really like her sense of humour. My mother is a housewife. It takes her much time and patience to look after the house. But she copes with her household chores very well. Besides, both my father and I help her with the housework. For example, I do the dishes and my father goes shopping. She is keen on cooking so she spends much time in the kitchen. My father likes stamp collecting and when a child I got interested in it as well. Since that time, stamps and old coins have become my hobby. We have a big collection of them. We also like music and everybody who visits us is impressed with our CD and DVD collection. I enjoy spending time with my family very much. We often go for a walk together. My family is fond of travelling. We visit different countries and have great time. So I could definitely say we are a very friendly family.
