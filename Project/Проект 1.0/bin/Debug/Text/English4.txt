The United Kingdom, officially the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, is an island nation and constitutional monarchy in north-western Europe, member of the European Union. Great Britain is the largest of the British Isles. It comprises, together with numerous smaller islands, England and Scotland, and the principality of Wales. Northern Ireland, also known as Ulster, occupies the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland. The United Kingdom is separated from continental Europe by the English Channel, in the east it is limited by the North Sea, and in the west by the Irish Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. The only land border is between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland .The total area of the United Kingdom is 242 sq km. The names United Kingdom, Great Britain and England are often used interchangeably. The use of Great Britain, often shortened to Britain, to describe the whole kingdom is common and widely accepted, although strictly speaking it does not include Northern Ireland. However, the use of the word «England» to mean the United Kingdom is not acceptable to members of the other constituent countries, especially the Scots and the Welsh. England and Wales were united administratively, politically and legally by 1543. The crowns of England and Scotland were united in 1603, but these two countries remained separate political entities until the 1707 Act of Union, which formed the Kingdom of Great Britain with a single legislature. From 1801, when Great Britain and Ireland were united, until the formal establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, the kingdom was officially named the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The mainland of the island of Great Britain is 974 km at its longest part and 531 km at its widest. However, the highly indented nature of the island’s coastline means that nowhere there is a place more than about 120 km from the sea. The climate of the United Kingdom is mild relative to its latitude, which is the same as that of Labrador in Canada. The mildness is an effect of the warm Gulf Stream. Winter temperatures seldom are below – 10 ?C and summer temperatures rarely higher than 32 ?C. The sea winds also bring plenty of moisture, average annual precipitation is more than 1,000 mm. The population of the country is more than 56 mln people, but it is one of the world’s leading commercial and industrialized nations. In terms of gross national product (GNP) it ranks fifth in the world, with Italy, after the United States, Japan, Germany and France.
