The protection of the environment is now the question of life or death on the Earth. There are many problems which threaten our natural environment. Water and soil pollution, the destruction of the ozone layer, acid rain, global warming, deforestation, oil spills, littering are among the most serious ones. Every year the world’s industry pollutes the atmosphere with millions of tons of dust and other harmful substances. The seas and rivers are poisoned with industrial waste and poisonous chemicals. During many processes poisonous gases (carbon dioxide, for example) are released into the air. These gases destroy the ozone layer of the atmosphere. It is very dangerous, because this ozone layer protects the Earth against the space radiation which can be harmful to both people and wild nature. Acid rain is found mostly in Europe and North America. These areas of the planet have the most cars and power stations, which produce harmful chemicals. These then go into the air and mix with the water in clouds to produce acid rain. The trouble begins when polluted rain falls as it damages plants and animals. In fact the fish in hundreds of lakes in Europe and North America have almost died out completely because of acid rain. Cities are also suffering from the effects of this powerful form of pollution. Acid rain can slowly eat away the stone on the outside walls of buildings, and historic monuments can be severely damaged. Many species of animals are endangered because they are losing their natural habitat or their food is contaminated with pesticides which slowly kill them. Many animals suffer from illegal hunting. Some man-made accidents threaten wildlife and the ecosystem. Although these accidents are relatively rare because of increased safety procedures, accidents still occur, sometimes with devastating effects. Examples include oil spills, radioactive leaks, tanker spills, pipeline bursts. Water is precious but it is also a scarce resource that needs to be preserved for future generations. Sustainable use of it is therefore vital to enable future life of our planet. Water pollution is a growing problem globally. Large industries including those that make chemicals and plastics dump a large amount of waste into the water. Human waste and rubbish also end up in the oceans and lakes. The mishandling of hazardous waste materials poses immediate and long-term risks to plants, animals, humans and the environment. Man-made chemicals released into the dirt either by accident or through poor disposal techniques cause soil contamination. Rupture of underground storage tanks, acid rain, leaching of hazardous waste from landfills, pesticides, and discharge from industrial chemical wastes all can contaminate the soil in which farmers grow crops or graze livestock that people eventually eat. On the other hand, if the pollution is not stopped we’ll die out anyway. We must set up national parks, protect natural habitat of animals, introduce harsher punishments for poaching and reduce demand for fur, ivory etc. We must invent new, waste-free and nature-friendly technologies and encourage industries to use cleaner methods of production. We should educate the public about the importance of recycling and raise public awareness about endangered species. We must develop and produce special water and air purifiers and filters. There is an international organization called Green Peace which fights against pollution and protects our nature. There is a good formula of RRR. It is Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. We can reduce the usage of electricity and drinking water. We must make an effort to recycle such things as plastic bottles, metal, paper, glass. The topic of environmental problems and their effective solutions is quite complicated and difficult to understand. It is, however, the attitude of human beings towards using the natural resources that is going to influence the environment to a great extent.
