The IT profession is respected globally because of the impact Information Technology (IT) has on society.  IT is used in solving problems and creating solutions. All sectors of the economy require the services of skilled technical IT personnel. Information technology professionals are responsible for designing, developing, supporting and managing computer hardware, computer software, maintaining, installing, configuring and managing IT systems and networks, including the Internet. IT is a field that emphasizes knowledge and personal contribution. A career in IT offers not only money, but much more than money. A career is about self-actualization issues – knowledge, empowerment, recognition, opportunity, influence, reputation, and self-reliance. But if immediate results are what you are after, then the IT field might not be what you want. An IT career is more like a marathon than a short sprint. Most computer related jobs require a bachelor’s degree. For some positions, a master's degree is preferred. Relevant skills and experience matter. The way to become an IT professional is studying a degree at university which teaches you the fundamentals first. At the university you not only get the knowledge but also: get the stamp on your resume (Once they open a certain job, organizations use filters to fill it in appropriately, and one of the filters is the university degree); create  the network of people (meeting different people increases your possibilities to find a good job; getting in contact with professors,  lecturers and the like might help you to develop professional projects, the university also offers many channels to get in touch with companies and organizations, including the contact of people working inside the HR department.); develop the competencies. Apart from the knowledge the university teaches you how to collect, filter, interpret and present information. It also teaches you to communicate clearly, to interact with other people, to take responsibility of your actions, and so on. All those competencies will be useful for the rest of your life regardless of the career you will choose. The knowledge you learn at the university will come and go while competencies stay once you develop them. Knowing what to expect out of something is half way through, so make sure you get it all from your experience at the university. In IT tomorrow is unpredictable. This is the very field where if you stand still you will go backwards. Once you have more information you are in a better position to know what you want. Be resourceful in finding information and keeping yourself up to date. Keep on learning and acquiring knowledge through the Internet, books, training and practice. Read IT journals and the computer sections of most newspapers and magazines. Talk to people on the job – get info on the good and the bad. As the Chinese proverb states, the stranger that asks questions doesn’t get lost. Visit the workplace, get familiar with and understand the working environments. Competent IT practitioners are often respected and recognized for their contributions. Becoming respected in IT requires creativity, the ability to handle challenges, to have excellent problem solving skills, a healthy respect for others and an always-learning attitude. The profession is respected but each individual must create his or her own path. You can be highly respected in IT if you manage your relationships well. You need to have very good interpersonal skills and know the value of good teamwork. Do you help and encourage others? You know the stuff, you’ve got the certs but how courteous are you in making your demands? Will you treat colleagues, clients and employers with respect? Are you considerate and evenhanded in your interactions and working relationships? The way you resolve conflict is also about respect.
